Patients with AF have a higher incidence of renal dysfunction, and the latter predisposes to incident AF. The coexistence of both conditions results in a higher risk for thromboembolic-related adverse events but a paradoxical increased hemorrhagic risk. Oral anticoagulants (both vitamin K antagonists [VKAs] and non-VKA oral anticoagulants [NOACs]) have been demonstrated to be effective in\u00a0mild to moderate renal dysfunction. Patients with severe renal impairment were excluded from the non-VKA oral anticoagulant trials, so limited data are available. In end-stage renal failure, the net clinical benefit of VKAs in dialysis-dependent patients remains uncertain, although some evidence suggests that such patients may do well with high-quality anticoagulation control. Risk stratification and careful follow-up of such patients are necessary to ensure a net clinical benefit from thromboprophylaxis.<\/p>\n"}],"journal":"Journal of the American College of Cardiology","journalIssn":"1558-3597","publicationTypes":[{"publication_type":"Journal Article"},{"publication_type":"Review"}],"audioDuration":"00:01:13"}]
